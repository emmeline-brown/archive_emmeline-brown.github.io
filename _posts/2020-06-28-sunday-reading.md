Though possibly this could just go on a goodreads or blogreads, instead it's going here # this way I can add a few more comments and get some more experience of github.io.
Here are a few things I have read this Sunday:

1) Like a good aspiring tech bro* I have read about dun dun dunnn... personal development.
https://medium.com/@iosipratama/21-examples-of-personal-development-goals-for-a-better-you-7dddcbc2f1b1 (soon I will be able to microdose, fall asleep at the wheel of
my Tesla, and high five all my female colleagues like the best of them).

2) Secondly, in a similar vein, I read How to Spend it, https://howtospendit.ft.com/mens-style/208114-how-dress-like-tech-bro. My synopsis of this article
is that those in the Valley have affected variations on the Steve Jobs turtleneck and the Mark Zuckerberg greyscale to demonstrate their commitment to functionality
and code while rebelling against corporate norms.

Per the article: 'The dogma is that minimalism and monotony yield extra productivity. “I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible 
about anything except how to best serve this community,”'

I guess what grates me about this is that it has a whiff of philistinism. Fashion is a blight in some regards, but it is art. Not that anyone is going to be wearing
Richard Quinn in the office, but curating minimalist turtlenecks is also a fashion choice. I think it makes a nice soundbite to say "this is my level of commitment",
though I can't imagine it giving you a competitive advantage (re time) over someone wearing a tailored suit. These days wearing your usual clothes to work
is just normal, rather than indicating all huel consuming dedication. Anyway, their conclusion is similar: "it’s hard to code individual style."

FTFashion is pretty good generally. I particularly liked its analysis of Dominic Cummings' apologywear (Barnard Castle):

It's another analysis of apparent casual/plain/ragged look implementation of the "red sneakers effect"

3) Next I read: https://medium.com/pytorch/pytorch-computer-vision-library-for-experts-and-beginners-84b9157584e5. This blog post is about a Computer Vision recipes 
repository, which provides detailed instructions of different Computer Vision scenarios and advice for pitfalls that are likely to occur. It's the kind of post that is
useful if you are working on a specific project.

*Just to clarify I do not aspire to being a tech bro.
